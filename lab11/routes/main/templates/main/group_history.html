 <h3>Formation and Swan Songs (2005–2009)</h3>
  <span>The band originated on June 3, 2005, as The Kids[8] from a song titled "Hollywood" (Later released as "The Kids") that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Aron Erlichman (Deuce), and Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff) posted on the band's MySpace profile to positive reviews,[9] leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends George "Johnny 3 Tears" Ragan (formerly known as "The Server"), Jordon "Charlie Scene" Terrell, Dylan "Funny Man" Alvarez, and Matthew "Da Kurlzz" Busek.[10] In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band "Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band."[11] Phillips later left the group because of conflict with Erlichman.</span>
 <span>The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album.

 <h3>Departure of Deuce and American Tragedy (2010–2011)</h3>

 <span>The band soon began writing material for their second studio album, American Tragedy,[27] in mid-2010, with hopes to release it by the end of the year.[28] The band co-headlined the Nightmare After Christmas Tour with Avenged Sevenfold and Stone Sour to support the album.
